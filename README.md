This study evaluates the impact of the ECOWAP (Economic Community of West African States Agricultural Policy) on agricultural productivity, GDP, and CO2 emissions in West African countries. While regional agricultural policies are pivotal for food security and economic development, their broader effects on sustainability and economic growth remain insufficiently explored. Using both differences-in-differences (DiD) and matching methods, which yielded consistent results, this study compares the outcomes of ECOWAP member states to non-member countries over a defined period. The findings show a significant increase in agricultural productivity, particularly in cereal production, within ECOWAP countries. However, no significant effect was found on GDP or CO2 emissions. These results suggest that while ECOWAP has contributed to agricultural growth, its impact on broader economic performance and environmental sustainability remains limited. Further research is needed to refine the methodology and explore the policyâ€™s long-term effects on economic integration, climate resilience, and sustainability.
